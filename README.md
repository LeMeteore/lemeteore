### I am using GitHub but I should not

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop Free and Open Source Software projects.

### Git is a distributed version control system.

Developers should not be coerced to have accounts on any single platform to [contribute](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project) to Free and Open Source Software projects. [Patches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Email) can be sent via and [applied](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Maintaining-a-Project) from emails.

### Addiction, pervasiveness and dominance

Github (Gitlab too) have become the Facebook-Twitter of coders. Merchants of "sweet approval", intermediaries we designated when we became desperate for the attention of others online.

Our insatiable desire for commentary, 'stars' & pull-requests has gifted that enterprise an immense gravity. While we are hooked on their mesmerising gimmicks, students are taught Github's interface instead of `git` commands and are expected to have an account with them if they are to register on the corporate map when searching for a job.

Worse still, we may have lost our soul. Would we write code if no one was watching? For the enjoyment of the practice itself? Those answering _yes_, fear not, you don't need them! [There](https://pagure.io/) [are](https://notabug.org/explore/repos) [plenty](https://code.launchpad.net/) [of](https://sr.ht/) [alternatives](https://codeberg.org/explore/repos)

Let's move on, there is still a community out there, where we stand a better chance of (literally) unscripted interaction. Our Free and Open Source code, has propped their dominance for too long. It's time to take it back!

I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host Free and Open Source Software projects.
